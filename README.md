mood disorder

-16 or ‘age range’ dni unless i mutually consider you as family. im open to talk! if you dont know what that means: i don’t usually talk to anyone under 16 unless i see you as an internet relative. thanks! if you see me interacting with someone under 16, theyre my internet relative ^^

im not comfortable with people bringing up nsfw topics with me, unless its about things like sexual health, taboos, or education (like menstruation), or if youre in my age range. there are some exceptions, but please be mindful. im sexually ambivalent, so i do talk openly about sex when its educational. also, please dont thirst over my ocs unless youve asked for permission first (mistake from alot of people /lh)

> anyways check out my art
