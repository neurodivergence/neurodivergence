my comms are open :) feel free to dm @crippledinwheelchair in disc for prices. its never above 15 dollar

i struggle with mood congruence (example: laughing at funeral when youre supposed to be grieving) because i have bipolar. my emotions are innapropriate and insensitive but its underlying mental health issue please understand that before interacting with me

-16 dni unless i consider you as a family mutually, im open to talk

> anyways check out my art
