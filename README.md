my comms are open :) feel free to dm @crippledinwheelchair in disc for prices. its never above 15 dollar

im very hesitant on interacting with people and would rather stick to circle of closed friends i have. but i do not mind being interacted! i do not bite

if im inactive for some time, its mental health issue

-16 dni unless i consider you as a family mutually, im open to talk
